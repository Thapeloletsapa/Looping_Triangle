# Inverted Triangle Pattern Generator

This project generates an inverted triangle pattern using a specified character and count. The triangle is created by padding spaces and characters to form a visually centered pattern.

## Usage

The script uses the following parameters:

- `character`: The character to form the triangle.
- `count`: The number of rows in the triangle.
- `inverted`: Boolean to specify if the triangle should be inverted.
